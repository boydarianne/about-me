          “Resilience is accepting your new reality, even if it’s less good than
          the one you had before. You can fight it, you can do nothing but
          scream about what you’ve lost, or you can accept that and try to put
          together something that’s good.” ― Elizabeth Edwards

          <strong><u>Biography</u></strong
          ><br />
          I am Arianne Boyd. I am from New Olreans, LA but I have lived in
          multiple places including Mississippi, Texas, and Georgia. I have
          always been into the arts. Throughout my life I focused heavily on art
          and dance until I began college and started to focus on what I thought
          I wanted in a career. I picked art up again in 2017 and it became a
          side job where I would get hired to do commissioned pieces but I
          realized that was also not as fulfilling as creating for myself and
          allowing others to enjoy it. So I find myself now seeking avenues that
          bring me joy and financial stability. I have a one year old son that I
          am looking to provide everything for and I want him to be rpoud of who
          his mom is.

          <strong><u>Education</u></strong
          ><br />
          I graduated from Jackson State University with my degree in Biology.
          Originally I wanted to be a veterinarian until I realized my love for
          animals stopped at petting and cuddling. I did not see myself
          operating on animals, seeing them in tough situations, or worse,
          euthanizing them when necessary. I find that I like learning code
          because I am a person that likes a challenge and it is an attribute
          that I am beginning to lean more into.

          <strong><u>Job Overview</u></strong
          ><br />
          I have an extensive background in sales that has allowed me to gain
          valuable skills and experience including but not limited to the skill
          of being able to talk to anyone, asking questions that would allow me
          to offer products and services tailored to one's personal needs, and
          how to work both as a team and as an individual. Interestingly I was
          also a flight attendant which was such a new experience I did not see
          coming. I was very comfortable with people but this placed me in a
          more authoratative position as I had to manage myself and everyone on
          the plane. I learned a lot about safety and developed an eye for
          detail. As flight attendants we had to develop an awareness for things
          such as human trafficking, bombs, terrorist, drunk and even sick
          passengers.
